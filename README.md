# Customer Purchase Behaviour Segmentation & Recommender System
## 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning with Clustering

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior and recommends products based on customer segments. 
It's useful for businesses seeking to understand customer profiles and personalize marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Segment customers into distinct groups based on buying patterns.
- Build a basic recommender model from cluster insights.
- Use unsupervised learning (KMeans clustering) for segmentation.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes customer features such as:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income`
- `Spending Score`

These features are used to identify patterns in customer spending behavior; 
applying feature engineering techniques.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Scikit-learn** – KMeans clustering algorithm
- **Plotly** – Interactive cluster visualizations

## 🔍 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and checked data consistency.
2. **EDA:** Explored distribution of income, age, and spending scores.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Scaled numeric features for better clustering results.
4. **Clustering:** Applied KMeans clustering with Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters.
5. **Visualization:** Plotted clusters and analyzed segment behavior.
6. **Recommender Insight:** Suggested strategies or products for each customer group.

## 📈 Key Results

- Identified **3–5 distinct customer segments** with unique behaviors.
- Built interpretable visualizations for stakeholder decision-making.
- Showed potential for **targeted marketing and upselling** using simple clustering logic.
